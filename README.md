# Setting up our programming workspace

## Installing conda 
Follow the link: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/macos.html
(Don't forget to check if ~/.bashrc has the PATH). 

## Creating an environment
To set up a conda environment:

```conda create –name <name of environment> python=3.6```

```source activate <name of environment>```

```conda install -c <packages>```

## Useful packages to install:
1. Numpy: all the math, and arrays
2. Matplotlib: plots and histogramming
3. Pandas: dataframes (similar to a spreadsheet)
4. IPython: to work with Jupyter Lab

## Github commands
- ```git clone <link of repo>```: download the repository
- ```git commit -m ”reason for commitment”``` : commits changes to the git repository
- ```git push``` : pushes committed changes to the git repository.
- ``` git pull```: updates you local branch from the master. 

## Jupyter notebook
In the terminal type ```jupyter notebook```, and the Jupyter workspace will open. Here you can create, and edit notebooks (.ipynb) or python (.py) files.
